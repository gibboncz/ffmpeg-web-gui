This is a PHP script for FFmpeg which allows you to upload a video and convert it into html5 (mp4 h264, webm, ogv). Using a simple graphical user interface (GUI) you are also able to fine tune the ffmpeg command and optimise the these following options:-

* Video size
* Video bit rate
* Frame rate
* De interlacing
* Enable Audio
* Audio sampling rate
* Audio bit rate
* Amount of channels (Stereo or Mono)
* And other features to come!

The script also generates 5 stills from the video allowing you to use these as placement holders. The ffmpeg web GUI script also generates the html for the html5 player, with flash fall-back. HTML5 video is fully supported in iPads and latest web browsers.
